                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Work Experience</h1>
                <p>Prior to starting graduate school, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer, where my primary focus was on addressing issues related to AI bias and fairness in computer vision systems. In this role, I developed and implemented algorithms aimed at reducing bias and improving the ethical outcomes of machine learning models. This experience not only honed my technical skills in machine learning and computer vision but also deepened my understanding of the societal impact and ethical considerations associated with AI technologies.</p>

                <h1>Research Experience</h1>
                <p>In addition to my professional experience, I have a strong research background in Computer Vision and AI Fairness. My contributions in these areas have led to multiple publications in top-tier, Q1 journals. Throughout my research journey, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of collaborating with renowned institutions, including the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, the National University of Singapore, and Ghent University. These collaborations have allowed me to deepen my expertise and engage with cutting-edge advancements in AI and machine learning.</p>

                <h1>Future Goals</h1>
                <p>Looking ahead, I aim to transition into Quantitative Research, as it closely aligns with my work in Data Science. To support this shift, I am actively pursuing advanced courses in Mathematics and Statistics to build a strong foundational knowledge in this area.
